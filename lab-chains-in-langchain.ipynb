Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, which is also known as the \"top of the stack.\" Stacks are typically used for tasks that require backtracking or undo operations, such as in function calls or expression evaluation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front, which is also known as the \"front of the queue.\" Queues are commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be processed in the order it was received, such as in task scheduling or message passing.\\n\\nIn summary, the main difference between a stack and a queue is their order of operations - a stack uses LIFO while a queue uses FIFO.'"

       "\"The main causes of the French Revolution can be attributed to a combination of social, political, and economic factors. \\n\\n1. Social Inequality: The French society was divided into three estates, with the clergy and nobility enjoying privileges and exemptions from taxes, while the common people, or the Third Estate, bore the burden of heavy taxation and poverty. This social inequality created resentment and discontent among the lower classes.\\n\\n2. Economic Crisis: France was facing a severe economic crisis due to years of extravagant spending by the monarchy, costly wars, and poor harvests. This led to widespread poverty, hunger, and unemployment, further fueling the discontent among the people.\\n\\n3. Political Corruption: The absolute monarchy of Louis XVI was characterized by corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of accountability. The monarchy's refusal to reform and address the grievances of the people only exacerbated the situation.\\n\\n4. Enlightenment Ideas: The Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity inspired many French intellectuals and common people to question the existing social and political order. The spread of these ideas through literature, salons, and pamphlets played a significant role in shaping the revolutionary sentiment.\\n\\n5. Financial Crisis: The French government was on the brink of bankruptcy, with mounting debts and a dysfunctional tax system. Attempts to reform the financial system, such as the convening of the Estates-General in 1789, ultimately led to the outbreak of the revolution.\\n\\nOverall, the French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that was driven by a combination of social, economic, political, and intellectual factors. It marked a turning point in French history and had far-reaching consequences for the country and the world.\""
